Welcome to Extended Conversation, the official weblog of the [XMPP Standards Foundation](https://xmpp.org/xsf/) (XSF).

Although many members of the Jabber/XMPP community have their own individual blogs (syndicated at [Planet Jabber](http://planet.jabber.org/)), here we will post news and views from the XSF itself: information about XMPP-related standards work within the [IETF](http://www.ietf.org/), notices about [XMPP extensions](https://xmpp.org/extensions/) that have been published or advanced within the XSF, updates about XSF initiatives such as the [intermediate certification authority](https://www.xmpp.net/), and more.

Those who develop Jabber/XMPP technologies have long cherished both freedom of conversation and the ability to extend those technologies in innovative ways, and we will continue that tradition here.

So welcome -- and let's continue the conversation together!
