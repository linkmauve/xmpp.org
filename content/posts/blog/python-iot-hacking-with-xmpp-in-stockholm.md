On the 21rst November we will meet and use Python to build on [raspberry developer kits](http://iea.sust.se/2013/09/01/preparation-of-devkits/ "devkits") and connect things through the [XMPP IoT extensions](https://xmpp.org/xmpp-protocols/xmpp-extensions/ "XMPP extensions").

[At the meetup event](http://www.meetup.com/pysthlm/events/145659642/ "Meetup") we will have sensors and actuators connected to raspberries and create interoperable interchange of data with the help of XMPP.

Interested in how [XMPP could be used in the *Internet of Things* arena](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Tech_pages/IoT_systems "IoT wiki") contact the organizer [Joachim Lindborg XSF](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/User:Jocke "Joachim Lindborg") or [Peter Waher XSF](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Peter_Waher_for_Council_2013 "Peter Waher")
