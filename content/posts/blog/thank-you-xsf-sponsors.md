We'd like to say a big "thank you" to two companies who have recently signed up as sponsors of the XMPP Standards Foundation.

[Erlang Solutions](https://xmpp.org/sponsor/our-sponsors/erlang-solutions/) are a new XSF sponsor who specialise in providing businesses with scalable solutions via the creation, integration, delivery and lifetime support of products and services based on the Erlang and Elixir programming languages.

[ProcessOne, a returning sponsor](https://xmpp.org/sponsor/our-sponsors/processone/), are a leading provider in messaging platforms designed for scale and robustness. ProcessOne have developed ejabberd, an ubiquitous XMPP server that has been deployed to power some of the largest messaging platform in the world. Many people will remember their CEO, Mickaël Rémond, as a member of the Board of the XSF for a number of years.

We were all very happy to see representatives from both Erlang Solutions and ProcessOne at the recent Summit 17 where they contributed greatly to discussions.

Thanks again to both of these great companies!
