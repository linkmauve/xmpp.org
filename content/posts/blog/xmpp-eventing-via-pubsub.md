Following in the grand tradition of [XEP-0076](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0076.html) (implementation in the Psi client [announced today](http://el-tramo.be/blog/malicious-stanzas)), [XEP-0132](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0132.html), [XEP-0148](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0148.html), and [XEP-0183](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0183.html), today we published [XEP-0207: XMPP Eventing via Pubsub (XEP)](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0207.html). This new "XEP XEP" is perhaps the most significant XMPP extension protocol yet published by the XMPP Standards Foundation, since it provides a solid, extensible foundation for any further payloads we might want to send over the network. [Read the spec](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0207.html) for complete details.
